        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span id="bold">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>
            <span id="bold">1933 </span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend
            the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
            known as the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="bold">1935 </span> - Has to stop school and save up more
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="bold">1937 </span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret
            Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
            Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
            about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="bold">1938 </span> - Tries to enroll in the military after
            the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
            asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
